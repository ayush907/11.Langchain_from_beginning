In a world once painted in crayons and dreams,
Where sunlight danced on gentle streams,
I lived the days of endless play,
Where morning merged with dusk and day.

The grass was greener, skies more blue,
With paper boats and skies we drew.
A stick became a wizard's wand,
A puddle — vast, enchanted pond.

Barefoot ran through streets so wide,
Chasing shadows, time our guide.
Kites would soar in April’s breeze,
Hearts alight, so full, so free.

A schoolbag heavy, but cares were light,
Lessons learned in morning’s light.
But more than math and scribbled lines,
We learned of love in subtle signs.

The scent of rain on thirsty ground,
The way our laughter had no bounds.
A bruise was healed with mother’s kiss,
A hug — a world of boundless bliss.

We played in lanes with dusty feet,
Made secret codes and plans to meet.
Trading marbles, dreams, and lore,
Swearing friendship forevermore.

The echo of a bedtime tale,
Of dragons fierce and ships that sail.
Tucked beneath the starry dome,
Each blanket fort a kingdom's home.

Sundays meant the comic stalls,
Sticky hands and cricket balls.
Chasing ice cream trucks in heat,
Every loss still felt like sweet.

Festivals brought colors bright,
New clothes, sweets, and candlelight.
Laughter spilling down the hall,
Uncles, aunties — we loved them all.

The worries were as small as ants,
Lost erasers, torn old pants.
The world was vast, yet felt so near,
With every heart so full, sincere.

But time, it marched with silent tread,
Those playgrounds now inside our head.
The dolls and cars packed in a chest,
The stories now just whispered rest.

Yet in the quiet, if you try,
You’ll hear a giggle float nearby.
A rustling breeze, a skipping beat —
Your childhood’s dancing down the street.

So let us toast those days gone by,
With a teary smile and softened eye.
For though we grow, we never part,
From that young child inside the heart.
